    <p>
        hi! my name is ---------- (yeah no i'm not sharing that)
        i've made another portfolio <a href="cosmosinity.onrender.com">here!</a>
        i have over 3+ years of experience with python, and 5+ with lua
        i also like doing modeling in roblox, but i can't really make the time for it
        i made this page mainly for testing stuff, so whenever i get a new machine i can easily test everything to make sure its working
        
        i like tinkering with old tech, especially old macbooks, iphones, ipads and all of that stuff
        i don't really use python, html or lua a lot now... but i used to love coding before
        so yeah that's it

        goodbye c:
