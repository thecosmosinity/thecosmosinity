    <p>
        hi!<br>
        i've made another portfolio <a href="cosmosinity.onrender.com">here!</a> <br>
        i have over 3+ years of experience with python, and 5+ with lua<br>
        i also like doing modeling in roblox, but i can't really make the time for it<br>
        i made this page mainly for testing stuff, so whenever i get a new machine i can easily test everything to make sure its working<br>
        <br>
        i like tinkering with old tech, especially old macbooks, iphones, ipads and all of that stuff<br>
        i don't really use python, html or lua a lot now... but i used to love coding before<br>
        so yeah that's it<br>
        <br>
        goodbye c: <br>
